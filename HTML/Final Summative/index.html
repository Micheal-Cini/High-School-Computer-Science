    <p>
        Welcome to my Portfolio! Throughout this website you will find out a little bit about me, as wells as the several projects I've done throughout my computer science journey! 
        <br>
        <br>
        My name is Micheal Cini, and I'm a grade 12 student with the hopes of earning my Computer Science masters degree at York University. However, it has not always been my dream
        to get my Computer Science degree. Originally my plan was to be a Computer Hardware Engineer. The only reason I've changed my mind is due to me realizing that a lot of the requirements
        to be an engineer are going to be to much to handle ecpesially during the COVID-19 school year. Due to that realization, I decided to follow the joy I get while problem solving and writing code.
        It has been so much fun learning how to code ecpesially with the help from my wonderful computer science teacher who is the main reason I can do what I can do.
        <br>
        P.S Make sure you wait until "Never gonna give you up" is over!
