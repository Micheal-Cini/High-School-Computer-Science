                <p style="width: 95%;">
                    This was our first assignment we had to do that was written in Python. We had to answer 5 different questions using the basics of python such as methods, loops, user input,
                    and print statements. Over all I do think that java is just a more organized, and easier to read code, but it was a lot of fun to learn a new language.

                    <p style="width: 95%; float: right;">
                        This project was just a little thing I made on my own time, not for school. It is an IP Grabber that asks the user for their name and then uses the email address to email the specified email address their name as well as their computers IP Address.
                        It was a lot of fun to figure out how to make unfortunately there are not many practical uses for it.

            <p style="text-align: left;">
               This is the first project we were assigned in the grade 12 year, as well as the first HTML assigment I've ever done. It was fun starting the year learning a simple language to get our brains working before the hard stuff.
                I really enjoyed how simple HTML is and how fun it is to design websites from scratch. As you can probably see, I liked the design of my first website so much I used it as inspiration for this website.
